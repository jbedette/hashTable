11/5    - get hash funcs working totatty
            -makeHash, pump out a key
            -sortHash, determine where hash will be
            
            -possibly make the creation table funcs
            -think i need to use **
            -make show funcs for testing ease
11/6    - make delete/remove funcs 
11/7    - pay/edit funcs
11/8    - cctype data reading types// maybe make this earlier

today 11/7 - i think i've got the adding workin
so the array of companies is fucked
    2 options
        1, never deal with !head
        2, fuck i don't know, spend another 3 hours on trying to make the * ->[] work
            god fucking damnit fuck fuck fuck shit
        
        i kinda suspect the array is populating correctly

11/14
    priority : - low = mid + high
    ++del isn't working
        resetting of ->next isn't working
    +find memory leaks
        delsingle is causing leaks, not deleting correctly
    +comment
        summary at top of each
        name + cs163 p3
        comment head file
    +need to test add single 
    =make destructor cleaner
    =make single disp show most recent
    =disp from company moved out of company class and into client
    =using every return
    -menu
        why do i need to enter values twice?
    -keep all funcs under 30
    -only use #include where needed
    -errors don't really work
    -make hash funcs just use size

eff notes
    on add, be better to add at beginning
    hash values could just use table.size
    could make search
    could combine populate/single add
    menu requires double input
